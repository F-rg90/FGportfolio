    <p>Originally from a neighborhood called Washington Heights in Manhattan, New York. Lived in SoFlo and NorCal.<br> 
      15 years in retail and sales. 7 of those years working management in electronics, automotive and product sales. <br>
      2 years working with a few startup companies.<br> 
      I trained and managed over 1000 people in my career and have met many more.<br>
      <br>
      Now, starting my career as a software engineer, I'll use everything i've learned to find a way <br>
      to change the world for the better or in the very least, the world around me. </p>
